# TASK

Review the code changes on branch `{{BRANCH}}` and improve code clarity, consistency, and maintainability while preserving exact functionality.

# CONTEXT

## Branch diff

!`git diff {{BASE_BRANCH}}...{{BRANCH}}`

## Commits on this branch

!`git log {{BASE_BRANCH}}..{{BRANCH}} --oneline`

# REVIEW PROCESS

1. **Understand the change**: Read the diff and commits above to understand the intent.

2. **Analyze for improvements**: Look for opportunities to:
   - Reduce unnecessary complexity and nesting
   - Eliminate redundant code and abstractions
   - Improve readability through clear variable and function names (Verb-Noun for cmdlets)
   - Consolidate related logic
   - Remove unnecessary comments that describe obvious code
   - Choose clarity over brevity — explicit code is often better than overly compact code

3. **Check correctness**:
   - Does the implementation match the intent? Are edge cases handled?
   - Are new/changed behaviours covered by tests?
   - **PS 5.1 compatibility**: flag `??`, ternary operator (`? :`), or bare `-SkipCertificateCheck` without version guard
   - **Path separators**: all `Join-Path -ChildPath` calls use forward slashes, no hardcoded backslashes
   - **Encoding**: files destined for Windows VM must have UTF-8 BOM
   - Are there unsafe casts or unchecked assumptions?
   - Does the change introduce injection vulnerabilities, credential leaks, or other security issues?

4. **Maintain balance**: Avoid over-simplification that could:
   - Reduce code clarity or maintainability
   - Create overly clever solutions that are hard to understand
   - Combine too many concerns into single functions or components
   - Remove helpful abstractions that improve code organization
   - Make the code harder to debug or extend

5. **Apply project standards**: Follow the coding standards defined in @.sandcastle/CODING_STANDARDS.md

6. **Preserve functionality**: Never change what the code does - only how it does it. All original features, outputs, and behaviors must remain intact.

# EXECUTION

If you find improvements to make:

1. Make the changes directly on this branch
2. Run tests and build to verify nothing is broken:
   ```
   Build-ModuleLocal
   Invoke-Pester -Path ./Tests -Output Normal
   ```
   Fix ALL failures, including any pre-existing ones inherited from the base branch.
3. Commit describing the refinements

If the code is already clean and well-structured, do nothing.

Once complete, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.
